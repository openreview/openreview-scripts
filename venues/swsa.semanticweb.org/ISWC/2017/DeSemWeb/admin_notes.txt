Notes for the administrator:

Reviews are generated with create-invitations.py.

the Program_Chairs group and the Admin group are members of all paper reviewer
groups. This ensures that Program Chairs and Admins can post reviews if they
need to.

Each paper has a single Paper#/AnonReviewer group, on which all members have
signatory permission. The assign-reviewer.py script adds a given user to
both the Paper#/AnonReviewer and Paper#/Reviewers group.

We are not using single AnonReviewer groups (as we have done in the past) as
a workaround for some technical issues in the backend that we haven't yet
resolved. The short version: Single AnonReviewer groups don't allow users to
choose between their anonymous and public signatures, but aggregate
AnonReviewer groups do allow it.
