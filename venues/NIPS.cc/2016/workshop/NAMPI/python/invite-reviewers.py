We would like to invite you to serve on the Program Committee for the Neural Abstract Machines & Program Induction (NAMPI) workshop at NIPS 2016. The workshop will broadly focus on neural approaches to computation, program induction, algorithm learning, abstract machines and data structures, and their relation to established learning and non-learning methods in the field.
