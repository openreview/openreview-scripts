'''
Reviewing Stage (~Oct. 8 - ~Oct. 29)

- Review assignments are deployed.
- Authors, reviewers, areachairs, and members of the public may continue to post comments under the same permissions as above.
- Reviewers and areachairs may no longer bid on papers.
- Review and meta-review tasks deployed.
- Reviews are visible to to paper area chairs and program chairs immediately upon creation.
- Reviews are hidden from reviewers until they post their own review.
- Reviews will be made available to the public during the rebuttal period
- Reviewer identity is revealed only to the paperâ€™s area chair and to the program chairs, *not* to the other reviewers. This is important so that reviews can be rated honestly later.
- - Important: reviewers *should not* reveal their identities in any part of the discussion.
- Reviewer and areachair assignments consoles are enabled.
- Area chairs can send messages and reminders to reviewers through the AC console.
