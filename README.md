# openreview-scripts
Scripts to populate OpenReview conferences. Most conferences use a client library written in Javascript. ICLR 2017 uses the latest Python library to allow conference organizers to run scripts themselves. This is a work in progress and is changing frequently.  

<<<<<<< 25cdf3cad4a75ce6b201739a056cfad437a9f03d
For now, the Python library uses the environment variables OPENREVIEW_USERNAME and OPENREVIEW PASSWORD to avoid the need for the user to enter his/her credentials every time they run a script. Set these environment variables in your ~/.bash_profile, or enter your credentials each time. If you choose to set only one of these (e.g. if you set OPENREVIEW_USERNAME but not OPENREVIEW_PASSWORD), you will be prompted for the missing value when you execute the script.
