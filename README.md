# openreview-scripts
This is a public repository containing scripts used to generate conferences, workshops, and other events using [OpenReview.net](https://openreview.net).

Scripts use the [openreview python library](https://github.com/iesl/openreview-py) to interact with the OpenReview API. Code for specific events are are organized in the `/venues` directory. Events are further organized by institution domain name, year, workshop name, etc.

## How to host your own event
If you would like to use OpenReview to host your own event, please contact us at info@openreview.net. 

Once your conference has been approved, we will provide you with an administrator-level username and password, and will help you get started with your event and provide technical support. For larger conferences, we can also provide some degree of administrative support.

OpenReview can also be used as an internal paper archive and reviewing system for labs and other organizations.
