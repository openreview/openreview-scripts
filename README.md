# openreview-scripts
Scripts to populate OpenReview conferences. Most conferences use a client library written in Javascript. ICLR 2017 uses the latest Python library to allow conference organizers to run scripts themselves. For details on ICLR 2017, please see the [ICLR 2017 readme](./iclr2017).

This is a work in progress and is changing frequently.
